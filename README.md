# Task 2 - SQL Insert, Update, Delete

## What I did

In this task I practice sql commands like insert, update and delete. Also I learn how to handle null values in table. I used DB Fiddle and write sql code there.

## Table Info

I created one table called students. It has columns:
- id
- name
- age
- email

## Insert Data

I inserted 4 students in table. Some rows has missing age or name, so I added null value for that.

## Update Data

I updated the missing age and name using update command with id so that only correct row get update.

## Delete Data

I used delete query to remove student whose age is more than 24. But since mySQL have safe mode, I used id in where condition also to make it work.

## Tools

- DB Fiddle (mySQL)
- GitHub

## File Added

- task2_data.sql : It has all sql code I wrote
